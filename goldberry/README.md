**Upgraded PokéGear** - Befriend team leaders and rival trainers, exchanging numbers to keep in contact. Friends may call to share tips on things they've found, or to challenge you to a rematch. Special opportunities may arise from building your relationships with each other.

**Regional Pokédex** - The Beri Region is home to 180 different species of Pokémon. Explore the lush forests, rocky mountain-sides, cool bay, and frozen peaks to catch 'em all! Grass, caves, trades, legendary rituals; there are so many ways to encounter Pokémon in the Beri Region! Once you've seen all there is to see, take a trip outside of Beri to find other Pokémon and complete your National Pokédex of over 250!

**Compete in Varying Challenges** - Lair, Club cups, Grand Prix, etc
