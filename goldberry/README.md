>Are there too many references to Berries? Good.

The main goals of Gold Berry are to be accessible to new players, challenging in post-game (with concepts based on Pokémon Stadium), and compatible with the vanilla games (including Stadium 2), all within a pseudo-open world with renewable resources. (Due to compatibility, no new mons, moves, or things like the Physical/Special split will be added) Gold Berry is intended to fit in with the original gen 2 games, so some minor decisions have been made for the sake of aesthetic and not feeling out of place in the gen 2 era. Gold Berry is being made with a heavy emphasis on multiplayer and Pokémon Stadium 2 interaction.

**A Constantly Moving World** - Across the many days in a week, and at the varying times of day, both people and Pokémon wander around the Beri region. As you adventure, you're sure to see some familiar faces making their own journeys. It would be worth your while to catch up with them when your paths cross, and learn from each other's stories.

**Challenge the Beri Pokémon Clubs** - The Beri region (and surrounding areas) host a variety of Pokémon Clubs, rather than Gyms which are common in many other regions. In these Clubs, trainers gather to share strategies, trade Pokémon, and of course train to become stronger. Any Club is led by a Team of powerful trainers who both accept challengers to award them with Club Badges, as well as host specialized tournaments inspired by those from White City's Stadium events.

**Upgraded PokéGear** - Befriend team leaders and rival trainers, exchanging numbers to keep in contact. Friends may call to share tips on things they've found, or to challenge you to a rematch. Special opportunities may arise from building your relationships with each other.

**Regional Pokédex** - The Beri region is home to 180 different species of Pokémon. Explore the lush forests, rocky mountain-sides, cool bay, and frozen peaks to catch 'em all! Grass, caves, trades, legendary rituals; there are so many ways to encounter Pokémon in the Beri region! Once you've seen all there is to see, take a trip outside of Beri to find other Pokémon and complete your National Pokédex of over 250!

**Lite-Shiny Pokémon** - In addition to the rare shiny Pokémon, there exists a slightly more common variant unique to the Beri region known as Lite-Shiny Pokémon. Why this phenomenon occurs is still unknown, but Prof. Olive has found that these rare breeds tend to be slightly more skilled in battle than their kin.

**Compete in Varying Challenges** - Lair, Club cups, Grand Prix, etc. Any trainer in possession of at least six Club Badges is permitted to compete in the Beri Region Grand Prix.
