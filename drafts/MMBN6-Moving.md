As a lot about my life recently has been up in the air, and there are many big changes both up ahead and already starting, I've found myself reminded of MegaMan Battle Network 6. A very specific and unusual game to be thinking about, since I haven't played it since it released in 2006 and I was... 11 years old?... Wow, okay, so it *has* been a long time.

Do you know that feeling, when you turn on a movie you used to watch all the time as a kid and now that you're older you understand its message a lot better? MegaMan Battle Network 6 (MMBN6 from now on) is like that to me, but turned inside out. I only played it once, despite loving the series as a whole and replaying the earlier games several times both back then, and still in recent years.

I'm getting a little ahead of myself though. What is MegaMan Battle Network, and what made the sixth entry in the series so different to me?

The games are played from the perspective of Lan Hikari and his AI companion MegaMan. Lan is a middle-schooler who lives in ACDC Town. (yes there are a lot of reference names. Moving on.) Each game sees Lan's regular daily life interrupted by various acts of futuristic network-based terrorism, which Lan and MegaMan team up to stop, defeating the villains in a mainly Monster of the Week style of story telling. By the end of each game, the duo end up saving the world from destruction in some way shape or form. Though the structure is played out and samey, the main draw of the series comes from its unique combat system which can best be described as a grid-based card-game active battle system. Really a very original and engaging means of combat, which I won't be talking about at all here since it's not actually gonna be relevant to my point in the slightest. What is relevant, is the life of a middle-school kid in his hometown, enjoying everyday life and heroic adventures alongside his friends he's grown up with.

At least for the first five games.

MMBN6 starts with a scene in Lan's classroom. His teacher explains that there's an announcement to be made, and asks Lan to stand up from his desk and address the class. Lan's friends are all confused, not knowing what this is about, and Lan explains that he'll be leaving the school and ACDC Town entirely, as his dad got a new job far away and his family is moving. Lan's friends are all shocked at the news, and frustrated that Lan didn't say anything to them sooner. Lan apologizes, explaining that he didn't know how to bring it up, and that having to leave has been hard for him to come to terms with. He just wanted to enjoy the time he had left in town like everything was normal. He thanks everyone for his time he's spent in ACDC Town (aka his entire young life so far), and admits that he'll be leaving tomorrow.

This is the *first* scene in the game. Playing this as a kid, I even felt blindsided by the news. Here I am, starting the new game of a series I'd played and come to know for five years, and the first thing I'm greeted with is "No, you don't get to step into this game world and enjoy time with all the characters you've come to know and love. We're ditching that right away." I was sad to know that this time I wouldn't be hanging out with Lan's friends, visiting the local card shop, fighting familiar villains, revisiting old places that Lan and co. had gone to over past summer vacations or holiday trips. All of the familiar comforts of this world were to be thrown away right from the start, and I'd do all these sorts of things in a whole new place, with new people, etc etc. The pinnacle of this disappointment being that I'd already heard that this would be the final game in the series. So here I am, 11 years old, ready to hop into the last game of one of my favorite series, preparing myself for the last big adventure with these characters in this world that I've come to love, and the game greets me with a big fat "Nope".

Now I think is a good time to explain something about my own life. Growing up, like everyone, I had friends who moved away. You're a kid, the internet isn't a big deal yet, and even moving across town to a different school district can be enough to mean saying goodbye to a friend forever, let alone moving across the country. But my family never moved. I always lived in the same house. I only ever changed schools once besides going to high school, and that happened the year after this game came out, so I didn't even have that point of reference yet. I didn't have any first-hand understanding of what Lan was dealing with, and honestly I really didn't want to. I *hated* change as a kid. Still not a huge fan, but I've gone through enough of it and grown up, so you just learn to deal with it. But back then, this was the worst way the game could have gone.
